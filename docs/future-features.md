# Future Features and Community Contributions

As PyBlade continues to grow, a few key directions for development are in consideration:

## Feature Suggestions

While PyBlade currently lacks a system for custom directives, community suggestions for new built-in directives are highly encouraged and will be considered as PyBlade evolves.

## PyBlade Intellisense

A planned extension, **PyBlade Intellisense**, will support syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and error checking in the most popular code editors (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text and JetBrains IDEs). This single, centralized extension will simplify PyBlade development across editors and serve as a base for the community to contribute.

## Extending PyBlade from Core Repository

To keep contributions manageable and cohesive, any additional features should ideally extend from the official PyBlade repository rather than creating independent versions. This ensures continuity and ease of maintenance as the project matures.
